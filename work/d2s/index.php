        My favorite part of working with Philip is he approaches problems from
        angles I often have not considered.
      </p>
      <p class="large-8 small-12 small-centered columns text-dark-blue">
        Philip is great with implementing and testing his ideas and he doesn't
        shy away from new technologies. Philip also communicates what he is
        doing really well and is not afraid to ask questions either.
      </p>

        If you are looking for a front-end developer that doesn't just operate
        as a task-taker and instead approaches development with zeal and
        incredible attention to detail, then you need to hire Philip. He is a
        quick learner and can easily adjust to new requirements in order to
        create a successful product.
