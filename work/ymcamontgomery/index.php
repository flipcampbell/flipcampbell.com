          The Montgomery, AL association of the YMCA contracted <a href="http://www.pixldesigns.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-green">Pixl Designs</a> to
          do a responsive redesign of their sites. Other developers at Pixl were
          responsible for building a custom child theme in WordPress on the
          Genesis Framework. My role was to implement page designs in HTML and
          LESS and also to build a mobile navigation menu.

        My favorite part of working with Philip is he approaches problems from
        angles I often have not considered.
      </p>
      <p class="large-8 small-12 small-centered columns text-dark-blue">
        Philip is great with implementing and testing his ideas and he doesn't
        shy away from new technologies. Philip also communicates what he is
        doing really well and is not afraid to ask questions either.
      </p>
      <p class="large-8 small-12 small-centered columns text-dark-blue">
        If you are looking for a front-end developer that doesn't just operate
        as a task-taker and instead approaches development with zeal and
        incredible attention to detail, then you need to hire Philip. He is a
        quick learner and can easily adjust to new requirements in order to
        create a successful product.
